One function of an operating system is file management. The OS is responsible for organizing files on storage media, including reading, writing, moving, and deleting of files. Most operating systems also have software to maintain the health of the storage media to extend its operating lifespan. 
Operating systems also perform memory management, facilitating transfer of information from storage media into operating memory (RAM) and the CPU. Most of this is concerned with memory protection. This includes functions like preventing programs from writing to the same area of memory, and keeping track of what pieces of a program have been stored in what chunk of memory.
