One function of an operating system is file management. The OS is responsible for organizing files on storage media, including reading, writing, moving, and deleting of files. Most operating systems also have software to maintain the health of the storage media to extend its operating lifespan. 
Operating systems also perform memory management, facilitating transfer of information from storage media into operating memory (RAM) and the CPU. Most of this is concerned with memory protection. This includes functions like preventing programs from writing to the same area of memory, and keeping track of what pieces of a program have been stored in what chunk of memory.
Operating systems also act as an interface between the device hardware and computer software through the use of drivers. Drivers can be written for multiple operating systems to allow the device to be used on multiple OSs. Most drivers are provided by the manufacturer, but others are written by other companies or even individuals, especially for older hardware that is no longer supported by the manufacturer.
